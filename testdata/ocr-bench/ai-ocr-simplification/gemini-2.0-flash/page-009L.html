```html <p>If the creature has just wounded you, you may <em>Test</em> your <em>Luck</em> to try to minimize the wound. If you are lucky, you have managed to avoid the full damage of the blow. Restore 1 point of <em>STAMINA</em> (i.e. instead of doing 2 points of damage it has done only 1) If you are unlucky, you have taken a more serious blow. Subtract 1 extra <em>STAMINA</em> point.</p>
<p>Remember that you must subtract 1 point from your own <em>LUCK</em> score each time you <em>Test</em> your <em>Luck</em>.</p>
<h1>Restoring Skill, Stamina and Luck</h1>
<h2>Skill</h2>
<p>Your <em>SKILL</em> score will not change much during your adventure. Occasionally, a page may give instruc- tions to increase or decrease your <em>SKILL</em> score. A Magic Weapon may increase your <em>SKILL</em>, but re- member that only one weapon can be used at a time! You cannot claim 2 <em>SKILL</em> bonuses for carrying two Magic Swords. Your <em>SKILL</em> score can never exceed its <em>Initial</em> value unless specifically instructed. Drink- ing the Potion of Skill (see later) will restore your <em>SKILL</em> to its <em>Initial</em> level at any time.</p>
<h2>Stamina and Provisions</h2>
<p>Your <em>STAMINA</em> score will change a lot during your adventure as you fight monsters and undertake arduous tasks. As you near your goal, your <em>STAM- INA</em> level may be dangerously low and battles may be particularly risky, so be careful!</p>
