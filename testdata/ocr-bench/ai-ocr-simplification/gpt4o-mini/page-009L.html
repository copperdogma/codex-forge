<h1>Restoring Skill, Stamina and Luck</h1>

<h2>Skill</h2>
<p>Your <strong>skill</strong> score will not change much during your adventure. Occasionally, a page may give instructions to increase or decrease your <strong>skill</strong> score. A Magic Weapon may increase your <strong>skill</strong>, but remember that only one weapon can be used at a time! You cannot claim 2 <strong>skill</strong> bonuses for carrying two Magic Swords. Your <strong>skill</strong> score can never exceed its <strong>Initial</strong> value unless specifically instructed. Drinking the Potion of Skill (see later) will restore your <strong>skill</strong> to its <strong>Initial</strong> level at any time.</p>

<h2>Stamina and Provisions</h2>
<p>Your <strong>stamina</strong> score will change a lot during your adventure as you fight monsters and undertake arduous tasks. As you near your goal, your <strong>stamina</strong> level may be dangerously low and battles may be particularly risky, so be careful!</p>
