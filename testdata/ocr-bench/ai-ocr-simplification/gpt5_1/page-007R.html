<p>First record the creature's <em>SKILL</em> and <em>STAMINA</em> scores in the first vacant Monster Encounter Box on your <em>Adventure Sheet</em>. The scores for each creature are given in the book each time you have an encounter.</p>
<p>The sequence of combat is then:</p>
<ol>
<li>Roll both dice once for the creature. Add its <em>SKILL</em> score. This total is the creature's Attack Strength.</li>
<li>Roll both dice once for yourself. Add the number rolled to your current <em>SKILL</em> score. This total is your Attack Strength.</li>
<li>If your Attack Strength is higher than that of the creature, you have wounded it. Proceed to step 4. If the creature's Attack Strength is higher than yours, it has wounded you. Proceed to step 5. If both Attack Strength totals are the same, you have avoided each other's blows - start the next Attack Round from step 1 above.</li>
<li>You have wounded the creature, so subtract 2 points from its <em>STAMINA</em> score. You may use your <em>LUCK</em> here to do additional damage (see over).</li>
<li>The creature has wounded you, so subtract 2 points from your own <em>STAMINA</em> score. Again you may use <em>LUCK</em> at this stage (see over).</li>
<li>Make the appropriate adjustments to either the creature's or your own <em>STAMINA</em> scores (and your <em>LUCK</em> score if you used <em>LUCK</em> - see over).</li>
<li>Begin the next Attack Round by returning to your current <em>SKILL</em> score and repeating steps</li>
</ol>
