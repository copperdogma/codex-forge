<h1>HOW TO FIGHT THE CREATURES OF DEATHTRAP DUNGEON</h1>
<p>Before embarking on your adventure, you must first determine your own strengths and weaknesses. You have in your possession a sword and a backpack containing provisions (food and drink) for the trip. You have been preparing for your quest by training yourself in swordplay and exercising vigorously to build up your stamina.</p>
<p>To see how effective your preparations have been you must use the dice to determine your initial <em>SKILL</em> and <em>STAMINA</em> scores. On pages 18-19 there is an <em>Adventure Sheet</em> which you may use to record the details of an adventure. On it you will find boxes for recording your <em>SKILL</em> and <em>STAMINA</em> scores.</p>
<p>You are advised to either record your scores on the <em>Adventure Sheet</em> in pencil, or make photocopies of the page to use in future adventures.</p>
