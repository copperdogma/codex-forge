+First record the creature's SKILL and STAMINA scores in the first vacant Monster Encounter Box on your Adventure Sheet. The scores for each creature are given in the book each time you have an encounter.
+The sequence of combat is then:
 Roll both dice once for the creature. Add its SKILL score. This total is the creature's Attack Strength.
 Roll both dice once for yourself. Add the number rolled to your current SKILL score. This total is your Attack Strength.
 If your Attack Strength is higher than that of the creature, you have wounded it. Proceed to step 4. If the creature's Attack Strength is higher than yours, it has wounded you. Proceed to step 5. If both Attack Strength totals are the same, you have avoided each other's blows - start the next Attack Round from step 1 above.
