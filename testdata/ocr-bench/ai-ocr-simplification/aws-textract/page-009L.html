<p>If the creature has just wounded you, you may Test</p><p>your Luck to try to minimize the wound. If you are</p><p>lucky, you have managed to avoid the full damage</p><p>of the blow. Restore 1 point of STAMINA (i.e. instead</p><p>of doing 2 points of damage it has done only 1). If</p><p>you are unlucky, you have taken a more serious</p><p>blow. Subtract 1 extra STAMINA point.</p><p>Remember that you must subtract 1 point from your</p><p>own LUCK score each time you Test your Luck.</p><p>Restoring Skill, Stamina and Luck</p><p>Skill</p><p>Your SKILL score will not change much during your</p><p>adventure. Occasionally, a page may give instruc-</p><p>tions to increase or decrease your SKILL score. A</p><p>Magic Weapon may increase your SKILL, but re-</p><p>member that only one weapon can be used at a time!</p><p>You cannot claim 2 SKILL bonuses for carrying two</p><p>Magic Swords. Your SKILL score can never exceed</p><p>its Initial value unless specifically instructed. Drink-</p><p>ing the Potion of Skill (see later) will restore your</p><p>SKILL to its Initial level at any time.</p><p>Stamina and Provisions</p><p>Your STAMINA score will change a lot during your</p><p>adventure as you fight monsters and undertake</p><p>arduous tasks. As you near your goal, your STAM-</p><p>INA level may be dangerously low and battles may</p><p>be particularly risky, SO be careful!</p><p>14</p>
