## Cover Blurb
Part story, part game, this is a tiny Hamlet-themed dungeon where YOU are the hero. Down in a torchlit keep under Elsinore, you will face traps, ghosts, and poisoned foils. Two dice, a pencil, and an eraser are all you need; luck and nerve will do the rest.

## How to Fight in Elsinore
Roll 1 die + 6 for SKILL, 2 dice + 12 for STAMINA, 1 die + 6 for LUCK. Record them.  
Combat Round:  
1) Roll 2d6 + SKILL for each side; higher total wounds the other for 2 STAMINA.  
2) Ties mean no damage.  
3) You may Test your Luck after wounding to add +2 damage if Lucky, or -1 damage if Unlucky. After being wounded you may Test your Luck to reduce damage to 1 if Lucky, or increase to 3 if Unlucky.  
Each Luck test reduces LUCK by 1. You cannot flee unless the text allows it.

## Equipment and Potions
You start with: sword, leather jerkin, backpack with 6 Provisions (restore 4 STAMINA each, not in combat), and one potion of your choice: Skill, Strength, or Fortune (+1 Initial LUCK and restores current LUCK). Each potion can be used once.

## Hints on Play
There is only one clean path to survive. Map as you go; numbers are sections, not pages. Read only the sections you are sent to. Keep initial scores as maxima unless told otherwise. This mini-book is intentionally short for smoke testing--expect quick deaths.

## Background
Baron Claudius now rules Elsinore. A ghost claims murder; a duel is rigged; poison waits on every table. You enter the underkeep with a violet scarf and a blade, sworn to uncover the truth and live through the night. Five other contenders stalk the corridors, but only one will see dawn. Will it be you?

## Section 1
You wake in Elsinore before dawn. A salty fog coils along the ramparts; something is wrong and you know it.  
If you **draw your cloak tight and head for the battlements**, turn to **2**.  
If you **sneak to your mother's chambers to demand answers**, turn to **3**.

## Section 2
Up on the wall, a ghostly figure wearing your father's crown beckons. Horatio trembles beside you.  
If you **follow the ghost to the tower stair**, turn to **4**.  
If you **tell Horatio to fetch guards instead**, turn to **5**.

## Section 3
Your mother, Queen Gertrude, startles as you enter. Claudius slips out a side door, smelling of wine.  
If you **challenge Claudius now**, turn to **6**.  
If you **pretend nothing is wrong and pour wine**, turn to **7**.

## Section 4
The ghost whispers: "Murdered by my brother; avenge me." The words freeze in your bones.  
If you **swear revenge immediately**, turn to **8**.  
If you **ask for proof instead of oaths**, turn to **5**.

## Section 5
By the time the guards arrive, the ghost has faded. They only see your shaking hands. You gain witnesses, but lose certainty.  
If you **investigate Claudius quietly**, turn to **7**.  
If you **rush to the chapel to catch him alone**, turn to **6**.

## Section 6
Steel flashes. Claudius staggers, shocked. You feel a brief, guilty triumph -- then horns blare outside. Norway's army was here for treaties, not war; now you have made one.  
Your story ends in blood and politics. **THE END**.

## Section 7
You trade polite nothing-talk and wine. Claudius smiles too wide. He invites you to fence Laertes tomorrow. You sense a trap but play along to buy time.  
If you **swap the practice foils for blunted ones tonight**, turn to **8**.  
If you **accept the match as-is**, turn to **6**.

## Section 8
You act with cold preparation: blunted foils, hidden antidote, trusted Horatio briefed. When the poisoned tip appears, you switch blades; Claudius is pricked by his own scheme. Gertrude overturns the poisoned cup.  
Denmark stumbles toward a quieter dawn. **YOU SURVIVE**.
