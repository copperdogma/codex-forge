# To Do

More personal notes for things that should be dealt with so I don't lose track of them.

- View In Pane + Load Metrics only give you a small window
- <div class="footer"> is not actually at bottom and is below a bunch of panels
- Panel links (Instrumentation: JSON report/Markdown summary) (Artifacts: Input PDF/Final JSON) don't show up well against the background colour
- pretty print "Open Artifact (new tab)" output and "View in Pane" + "Load metrics" tab output
