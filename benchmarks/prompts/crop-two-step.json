For each, note what text appears directly adjacent (captions, credit lines, labels).\n\nSTEP 2 — BOUNDING BOXES: For each visual element from Step 1, provide a tight bounding box that includes ONLY the visual element and excludes ALL adjacent text (captions, credits, page numbers, body text).\n\nReturn your final answer as JSON: {\"images\": [{\"description\": \"...\", \"adjacent_text\": \"...\", \"bbox\": [x0, y0, x1, y1]}]}\n\nCoordinates are normalized 0.0-1.0 where (0,0) is the top-left corner of the page.\n\nIMPORTANT: The bbox must NOT include any text. If you're unsure where text ends and the image begins, err on the side of a smaller box that definitely excludes text.\n\nReturn ONLY the JSON object."
