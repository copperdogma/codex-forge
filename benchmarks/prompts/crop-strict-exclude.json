Bounding boxes must contain ONLY the visual element — zero text of any kind\n2. Captions are NOT part of the image. If italic text like \"Aerial photo of ranch buildings\" appears below a photo, your box must end ABOVE that text.\n3. Credit lines like \"Illustration by...\" are NOT part of the image.\n4. Page numbers are NOT part of any image.\n5. If a photo has a physical border or frame in the print, include the border but not any text outside it.\n6. For oval/vignette photos, use a rectangular bounding box that tightly encloses the oval.\n7. Decorative title text (e.g., large stylized book titles) counts as a graphic element.\n\nReturn JSON: {\"images\": [{\"description\": \"...\", \"bbox\": [x0, y0, x1, y1]}]}\nCoordinates are normalized 0.0-1.0 (top-left origin).\nReturn ONLY the JSON."
