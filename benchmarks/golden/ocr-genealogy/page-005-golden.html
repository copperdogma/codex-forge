<h1>Moise and Sophie</h1>
<p><strong>The First Generation</strong></p>
<p>Moise L'Heureux was born in 1858 at Chateau Richer, Quebec, son of Pierre L'Heureux and Marie Trepanier. Sophie Pichette was born in 1861, also at Chateau Richer, daughter of George Pichet and Sophie Cauchon. Moise and Sophie were married on January 17, 1882 at Chateau Richer.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1891, Moise and Sophie, with their growing family, left Quebec to travel west. They journeyed by train to Swift Current, Saskatchewan, and from there made their way north by horse and wagon to the Battleford area.</p>
<p>They homesteaded on the south side of the North Saskatchewan River, near what would become the town of Vawn. Moise proved up on his homestead and the family established a farm that would become the foundation for the large L'Heureux family in the west.</p>

<p>Moise served the community as the first postmaster of the area, hauling mail from Battleford by team and democrat or sleigh, a distance of some 90 miles. Their home was a gathering place for settlers and travellers alike.</p>
