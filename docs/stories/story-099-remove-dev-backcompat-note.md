**Status**: To Do

## Acceptance Criteria
- Confirm the pipeline is production-ready (stability + coverage) and approved to shed dev-only caveats.
- Remove the “no backward compatibility preservation” disclaimer from `AGENTS.md` once production-ready.
- Update any other docs that reference the dev-only state to reflect production readiness.
- Log the change and readiness decision in this story’s Work Log.

## Tasks
- [ ] Verify production readiness (stability, test coverage, recent runs) and document the decision.
- [ ] Remove the dev-only backcompat disclaimer from `AGENTS.md`.
- [ ] Update related docs if they mention the dev-only state.
- [ ] Record the readiness decision and doc changes in the Work Log.
