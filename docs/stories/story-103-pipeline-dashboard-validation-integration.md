# Story: Pipeline Dashboard Validation Report Integration

**Status**: To Do

---

## Acceptance Criteria
- `pipeline-visibility.html` shows the currently running module/stage in the "Overall Progress" panel at the top, making it immediately visible which stage is active without scrolling.
- The "Artifacts" panel includes a link to `validation_report.html` when it exists for the run (generated when the validation stage completes with `forensics: true`).
- When a run is complete, the dashboard displays summary validation statistics from `validation_report.json`:
  - Status (VALID/INVALID)
  - Total Sections
  - Missing sections count
  - No Text sections count
  - No Choices sections count
  - Broken Links count
  - Orphans count
- Summary stats include a link to the full `validation_report.html` for detailed forensic analysis.
- Summary stats appear in a dedicated validation summary card or section, clearly visible after run completion.

## Tasks
- [ ] Enhance "Overall Progress" card to display the currently running stage/module name when run status is "running".
- [ ] Add logic to detect and link to `validation_report.html` in the Artifacts panel (check for `<run_dir>/validation_report.html` or find via stage artifact that matches `validation_report.json` → `.html`).
- [ ] Add function to read `validation_report.json` from run directory and extract summary statistics.
- [ ] Create validation summary display (card or section) that shows key metrics from `validation_report.json` when run is complete.
- [ ] Add link from summary stats to `validation_report.html` for full forensic report.
- [ ] Handle gracefully when validation report doesn't exist (e.g., run hasn't reached validation stage yet, or validation failed to produce report).

## Notes
- Validation report HTML is generated by `tools/generate_forensic_html.py` when `validate_ff_engine_v2` runs with `forensics: true` parameter.
- The JSON report (`validation_report.json`) lives in the run root directory and contains:
  - `is_valid` (boolean)
  - `total_sections` (integer)
  - `missing_sections` (array)
  - `sections_with_no_text` (array)
  - `sections_with_no_choices` (array)
  - `forensics.broken_links` (object keys)
  - `forensics.orphans` (object keys)
- Dashboard should fetch `validation_report.json` via relative path from current run directory.
- Currently running stage can be determined by finding the stage with `status: "running"` in `pipeline_state.json` stages.
- Module name is available via `stages[stage_id].module_id`.
