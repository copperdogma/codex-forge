Any time the Serpent's Attack Roll is 16 or better, it can coil around its foe. From then on, it automatically does 1 extra point of damage each combat round, regardless of who wins, until it flees or one combatant is destroyed. This does not apply to flying foes.

It looks like a gigantic snake! But as you approach, you see it is actually a robot, a Serpent VII. This unit was designed to track and hunt dinosaurs. It has no legs; its gripper-arms fold against the body when not in use. Its shape gives it good mobility in the jungle.

If you like, you can take the Serpent VII. If you already have a robot, make a note of the fact; this robot will be here should you return. If you have not already explored to the north, you may do so by turning to <a href="#16"> 16 </a> . Or you may leave off exploring the city and turn to <a href="#137"> 137 </a> .
