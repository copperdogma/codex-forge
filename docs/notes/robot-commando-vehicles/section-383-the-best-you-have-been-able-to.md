You wander around for hours, but the Administration Building is useless, and the other building is tightly locked and you cannot enter it. You must leave the Dinosaur Preserve and see what you can find. Unfortunately, the Dinosaur Preserve is far away from the rest of the City of Knowledge. After an hour of walking, the best you have been able to find is a battered old Farm Robot.
