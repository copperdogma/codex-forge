Whenever the Wasp’s Attack Roll exceeds its foe’s roll by 4 or more, it has literally flown circles around its foe! It automatically wins the next combat round as well – no rolls are necessary.
You may take it if you like. If you return here later, your old robot will be here instead of the Wasp. Return to 165 .

<p>
At the airfield, you find dozens of pleasure craft of all sorts, none of which looks useful. But parked in an out-of-the-way corner is a small but deadly-looking fighting-machine. It is a sleek experimental fighter, called a Wasp Fighter. Only a few exist. It has very little armour, but it has good weapons and handles well.
