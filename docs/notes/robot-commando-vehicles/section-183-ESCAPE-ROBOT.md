<p>
You push the 'Eject' button. To your surprise, your cockpit separates and takes off on its own! A second later, the rest of your robot explodes. Seeing the explosion, the Wasp loops away and disappears. You take stock of your new craft: the cockpit of your robot has grown stubby wings and short grasping arms. It is a tiny flying robot, just big enough to hold you—but enough to get you to your destination.
