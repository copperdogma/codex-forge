## Special Abilities (Full Text)

```
The Robotank contains a special Sonic Gun in one hand. It cannot be used by any other robot. It may be fired once per combat turn, in addition to the Robotank’s regular attack. However, it may be used only three times in all; then it is useless. When fired, the Sonic Gun is instantly deadly to unprotected humans. Against a robot, roll one die to see how many ARMOUR points the target loses. Against a dinosaur, roll two dice to see how many ARMOUR points the target loses.
There are three of these robots here. You may take one and leave ( turn to 376 ), or, if you prefer, you may turn to 167 to take a faster robot.

You have chosen a powerful Robotank. This fearsome war machine looks like a human from the waist up. From the waist down, it is a huge tank, with terrible twin guns. It is one of the few ‘battle-line’ machines your land possesses.
