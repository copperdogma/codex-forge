State-of-the-Art OCR Model Shortlist (2025)

Shortlist of Candidate Models (6–12)
	1.	OpenAI GPT‑5 Vision (OpenAI) – OpenAI’s latest multimodal GPT model, unifying advanced reasoning with image inputs.
	•	Release/Update: Initial release on Aug 7, 2025 ￼ (now the default ChatGPT model ￼).
	•	Pricing: ~$1.25 per million input tokens and $10 per million output tokens ￼. Supports a massive 400K-token context window ￼, enabling full book-length inputs.
	•	OCR Strengths: Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks ￼, with vast context and vision capability for complex documents. GPT-5 can analyze entire scanned books or multi-column pages in one go, leveraging its chain-of-thought “thinking” mode for accurate transcription and comprehension ￼ ￼. Hallucination rates and errors are significantly reduced versus earlier GPT models ￼, making it highly reliable for difficult OCR tasks (faint text, complex layouts, etc.).
	•	Known Limitations: Cost is high relative to specialized OCR APIs (e.g. ~$0.005 per page in output tokens). Also, being a general LLM, it is not explicitly constrained to literal transcription – it may inadvertently correct perceived errors or omit subtle layout cues without careful prompting. It lacks built-in layout structuring (output format must be guided via prompt). In practice, using GPT-5 for pure OCR might “overkill” simpler tasks and requires robust prompt design to avoid minor hallucinations or formatting loss (e.g. ensuring it doesn’t inject narrative text).
	2.	Google Gemini 3 Pro (Google Cloud) – Google’s latest flagship multimodal model in the Gemini family.
	•	Release/Update: Launched in preview Nov 18, 2025 ￼ as Google’s most advanced model (successor to PaLM 2), available via the Gemini API on Vertex AI ￼.
	•	Pricing: $2.00 per million input tokens, $12.00 per million output tokens (for prompts ≤200K tokens) ￼. Comparable pricing to GPT-5, with free quota in AI Studio for experimentation.
	•	OCR Strengths: Multimodal understanding and visual reasoning are core to Gemini 3 ￼. Earlier Gemini versions already performed on par with top models for document text extraction – e.g. Gemini 1.5 scored ~90% on internal OCR benchmarks, rivaling GPT-4 ￼. The new Gemini 3 further improved on AI vision benchmarks and spatial understanding ￼. It can intake images of pages and generate accurate transcriptions or even answer document questions in-context. As a Google product, it benefits from deep integration with Google’s OCR heritage (e.g. potentially leveraging Google’s DocAI quality for text) and tooling like search-grounding and structured output formats ￼ ￼. Gemini’s world knowledge and visual prowess enable it to handle complex layouts, diagrams, and mixed text/graphics in books.
	•	Known Limitations: Not a dedicated OCR engine – usage requires prompting the model appropriately (e.g. instructing it to output plain text or JSON). It may struggle to preserve exact layout or formatting (no native PDF/HTML output). Also, latency can be significant for large inputs (multi-hundred-thousand-token processing may take tens of seconds). As a newly released model, real-world OCR evaluations are limited (early tests show strong capability but slightly lower raw text accuracy than Mistral OCR in one internal benchmark ￼). Finally, cost at scale is on the higher side (similar to OpenAI), and users are subject to Google’s rate limits and data policies.
	3.	Anthropic Claude 4 (with Vision) – e.g. Claude Opus 4 (Anthropic) – Anthropic’s latest large model with image understanding.
	•	Release/Update: Claude 4 (in Sonnet and Opus variants) released May 22, 2025 ￼. Claude 3.5 (vision-capable) was introduced mid-2024 ￼; Claude 4 is its 2025 evolution with higher capacity and safety.
	•	Pricing: For Claude 4 via API – Claude Sonnet 4 (mid-tier): ~$3.00 per million input tokens, $15 per million output ￼ ￼. The more powerful Claude Opus 4 costs $15/$75 per million tokens input/output ￼. Context window 100K–1M tokens depending on model ￼. (Vision features included at no extra charge.)
	•	OCR Strengths: Claude’s vision models are known for robust text recognition in images. Claude 3.5 already “accurately transcribe[d] text from imperfect images” (glare, low-res, etc.) ￼ – a core capability for documents in retail, logistics, finance. It handles structured and unstructured docs: it was trained on images of charts, forms, diagrams, etc. ￼, allowing it to interpret tables or multi-column layouts. In an invoice parsing demo, Claude 3 extracted key fields into JSON reliably ￼ ￼. Claude 4 improves on this with greater reasoning depth (e.g. better at understanding context across pages). It also has a very large context window, which can help process long book chapters or multi-page documents in one prompt. Benchmarks: While no public OCR benchmark for Claude 4 is published, Claude 4 is generally on par with GPT-4/5 in language tasks, and Anthropic has positioned it for “complex, long-running tasks” including document analysis.
	•	Known Limitations: Higher cost than specialized OCR APIs (Claude Opus can be expensive if large output; Claude Sonnet is more affordable but slightly less accurate). The model, like other LLMs, may sometimes infer or “clean up” text unless instructed to output verbatim, so care is needed to get faithful transcriptions. Also, Claude’s formatting of output must be guided (though it supports tools/function calling to format JSON). Anthropic’s rate limits and the need to chunk very long documents (if over context limit) are additional considerations. Overall, Claude 4 is a powerful choice for understanding documents (even extracting structured data or answering questions), but pure OCR use might not justify its cost except for cases needing AI-level comprehension on top of text extraction.
	4.	Cohere Command A Vision (Cohere) – A 112B-parameter vision-language model focused on enterprise document understanding.
	•	Release/Update: Introduced July 31, 2025 ￼ ￼ as Cohere’s first multimodal model (“Command A Vision”) built on their Command A LLM architecture. Available via Cohere’s platform and as an open-weight research checkpoint (Aya Vision 8B) on HuggingFace ￼.
	•	Pricing: Enterprise API, contact for pricing. (Cohere uses a token-based pricing model; one source suggests on the order of $2.5 per million input tokens and $8 per million output for Command A Vision, similar to competitors.) Cohere also allows private/self-host deployments – the model can run with as little as 1–2 GPUs (with quantization) ￼, potentially reducing TCO for high volumes.
	•	OCR Strengths: Specifically optimized for OCR and document vision tasks. Cohere reports Command A Vision outperforms GPT-4.1 and other open models on standard benchmarks like OCRBench, DocVQA, ChartQA ￼ ￼. It not only reads text but also preserves document structure: the model can output parsed content as structured JSON (e.g. extracting fields from invoices or forms) ￼, which is a major plus for complex layouts. It supports ~23 languages and can handle mixed content (images, diagrams in PDFs) – e.g. interpreting graphs or identifying objects in photographs ￼ ￼. Because it’s built on Cohere’s Command model, it inherits strong language abilities and an architecture optimized for retrieval-type tasks, making it well-suited for document search or Q&A pipelines. Additionally, Cohere’s deployment flexibility (cloud or on-prem) can be valuable for data privacy.
	•	Known Limitations: As a newer entrant, real-world adoption is still growing. Pricing and access are enterprise-oriented (the full 112B model is proprietary; an 8B open version exists for research but is less capable). While it beats GPT-4 on certain vision benchmarks, OpenAI’s GPT-5 was not in those comparisons – so its absolute ranking vs. the very latest models is unverified. Also, its image input “tokenization” is chunk-based (an image consumes ~3,328 tokens ￼), which means large images add to prompt cost. Finally, like other LLMs, it may require prompt tuning to output exactly what is needed (e.g. toggling between plain text OCR vs. summarized data). Cohere’s model is very promising for enterprise OCR+AI use cases, but one should weigh the vendor lock-in and currently lower public mindshare compared to OpenAI/Google.
	5.	Mistral OCR (Mistral AI) – A dedicated multimodal OCR API built on Mistral’s LLM, designed for high-fidelity document transcription.
	•	Release/Update: Announced March 6, 2025 ￼ as “the world’s best document understanding API” by Mistral. Available as a cloud API (mistral-ocr-latest) on Mistral’s platform (La Plateforme) ￼; self-hosting available for select use-cases ￼.
	•	Pricing: Very low-cost – “1000 pages per $” (roughly $0.001 per page) ￼, with ~2× throughput efficiency on batch requests. This is an order of magnitude cheaper than most LLM-based services. (For comparison, ~0.15¢/page vs. 0.6–1.5¢/page for Azure/Google OCR ￼ ￼.)
	•	OCR Strengths: Mistral OCR is purpose-built for document OCR, combining vision and language understanding. It parses each element on the page – text, images, tables, math formulas – with “unprecedented accuracy,” outputting an ordered, interleaved text+image stream ￼ ￼. In Mistral’s internal benchmarks it outperforms other leading OCR solutions like Google DocAI, Azure OCR, and even general LLMs (Gemini 1.5, GPT-4 vision): e.g. Mistral OCR scored 94.9% overall vs ~89–90% for Azure and GPT-4 on a text-only OCR test set ￼. It particularly excels at complex layouts – tables, LaTeX equations, charts – maintaining structure and reading order ￼ ￼. It’s also natively multilingual, handling diverse scripts with top-tier accuracy (99%+ fuzzy-match on many languages vs ~95–97% for Azure/Google) ￼ ￼. Notably, Mistral OCR is designed to output in convenient formats: it can return Markdown or JSON with text and even base64 images of embedded figures ￼, which is useful for preserving document context. Throughput is high – up to ~2,000 pages per minute on a single node ￼ – making it suitable for large-scale digitization of books.
	•	Known Limitations: As a specialized solution from a startup, it is less proven by independent third parties (claims are primarily from Mistral’s data). The API is cloud-hosted by Mistral – users must upload documents to their service (which might be a concern for highly sensitive data, though on-prem editions are “selectively available” ￼). While extremely accurate in structured tests, it’s still an LLM under the hood; in rare cases it might mis-order text or hallucinate minor fillers (though Mistral likely minimized this behavior for pure OCR). Finally, the output being “interleaved” Markdown (with images inlined) is great for human reading, but if a precise preservation of layout (e.g. coordinates or original formatting) is needed, one might need to post-process the results. Overall, however, Mistral OCR offers top-tier accuracy at a fraction of the cost of competitors – it’s a prime candidate to replace multi-engine OCR pipelines.
	6.	Microsoft Azure AI Document Intelligence (formerly Azure Form Recognizer) – Microsoft’s cloud OCR and form understanding service.
	•	Release/Update: Ongoing improvements; latest v4.0 models (Layout, Read) launched April 2025 ￼. Azure’s OCR has evolved from legacy OCR and Read API to a unified Document Intelligence suite.
	•	Pricing: Pay-as-you-go. Basic OCR (Read) costs $1.50 per 1,000 pages (first 1M pages per month) ￼, dropping to $0.60 per 1,000 beyond that ￼. Structured extraction (tables, forms) uses the Analyze API and is pricier – e.g. ~$15 per 1,000 for tables, $50 per 1,000 for key-value forms ￼. (No upfront commitments required; a free tier provides 500 pages/month ￼.)
	•	OCR Strengths: Proven accuracy and layout fidelity on a wide variety of documents. Azure’s models rank among the top in OCR evaluations – for instance, Azure OCR was second only to Mistral in one internal benchmark (89.5% vs 94.9%) ￼, edging out Google’s offering. It supports printed text in dozens of languages and even handwriting recognition ￼. The service not only extracts text but also preserves structure: it can identify paragraphs, lines, tables, and form fields with bounding boxes. Table extraction in particular is a strength (Form Recognizer can output tables as CSV or JSON with cell structure). The latest models show strong performance on complex layouts and noisy scans – Microsoft reports ~99% accuracy on clear prints and significant improvements on curved or skewed documents. Another advantage is end-to-end solutions: Azure offers prebuilt models for invoices, receipts, IDs, etc., which layer business logic on OCR. For scanning books, the general Read + Layout models would likely be used, giving a reading order that’s quite reliable. Azure’s cloud can effortlessly scale to large batch jobs, and containerized models are available for on-prem deployment if needed ￼.
	•	Known Limitations: Cost can increase if you need full analysis – e.g. using forms or query features adds to the per-page price. For straight text extraction, however, it remains cheap (roughly $0.0015/page). Azure’s output is raw OCR (with coordinates and basic layout), but it won’t perform higher-level understanding or cleanup (you’d use an LLM or custom code for that). One practical limitation is the context is page-by-page – the service doesn’t inherently merge multi-page content in reading order (that logic must be client-side). Also, while Azure’s accuracy is high, extremely low-quality scans or unusual fonts might still need manual review (as with any OCR). Lastly, using Azure means sending data to the cloud (unless using containers), which for some projects introduces compliance considerations. Overall, Azure’s OCR offers an excellent quality-to-cost ratio for bulk English text OCR with available support for layout – it’s a strong baseline to compare against AI-first approaches.
	7.	Amazon Textract (AWS) – AWS’s managed OCR and form extraction service.
	•	Release/Update: Initially launched in 2019, with continual updates (added handwriting support, queries, and specialized APIs through 2023 ￼). It’s a mature service used in many production workflows.
	•	Pricing: Per-page pricing with no minimum. Plain text extraction (Detect Document Text API) is $0.0015 per page for the first million pages per month ￼ (then $0.0006 after 1M) ￼. Structured data APIs (Analyze Document for forms/tables) cost more: e.g. $0.05 per page for forms and $0.015 for tables ￼. In practice, parsing a page with both forms and tables could be ~$0.065 ￼. Textract offers volume discounts and a three-month free trial (1,000 pages text/month) ￼.
	•	OCR Strengths: Battle-tested accuracy and scalability. Textract uses deep learning under the hood (the same tech that powers Amazon’s internal document processing). It handles multi-column layouts, printed and cursive handwriting, and can automatically detect tables and form fields. A key feature is “Queries” – you can ask for specific fields from a document (e.g. “What is the book title?”) and Textract will return the answer without you parsing all text ￼. This is similar to an AI approach but using a fixed model. In terms of quality, Textract is on par with other top OCR engines for printed text. It tends to outperform open-source tools on low-quality scans and is fairly robust to noise ￼. It also provides confidence scores for each word, which is useful for QC. Another strength is integration: results come in structured JSON, and AWS provides SDKs to easily pipeline the OCR results into downstream AWS analytics or storage. For a book page, Textract will give each line and word with coordinates – allowing flexible post-processing (reflow into paragraphs, etc.). It can preserve tables (outputting cells) and has a layout feature akin to Azure’s. Latency is usually a few seconds per page (can process pages in parallel). Textract’s latest models have improved on tricky cases like rotated text, and it supports English well (plus ~10 other languages for printed text).
	•	Known Limitations: No built-in AI reasoning – Textract won’t summarize or correct OCR results. It is a straight extractor, so complex understanding (like figure analysis or long-range context across pages) isn’t available out of the box. For multi-page books, you’ll need to assemble pages yourself after OCR. Textract also doesn’t return rich text formatting beyond basic structure; if preserving exact appearance (fonts, styles) is needed, a PDF is preferable. In terms of cost, while cheap per page, large volumes (millions of pages) could become costly relative to self-hosting open-source alternatives. Vendor lock-in is a consideration: you must call AWS endpoints (though AWS assures high security, some organizations require on-prem solutions). Lastly, Textract’s accuracy on very complex documents (scientific layouts, dense tables) is good but might not reach the precision of a specialized model like Mistral OCR in edge cases. However, for an “AI-first” pipeline, Textract is a strong conventional baseline – it’s fast, reasonably priced, and high-accuracy for pure OCR needs ￼ ￼.
	8.	ABBYY FineReader / Cloud OCR SDK (ABBYY) – A leading traditional OCR engine with modern AI tweaks, offered as a cloud API.
	•	Release/Update: ABBYY FineReader has a long legacy (over 20 years in OCR); the latest version uses AI-based recognition and up-to-date language models. The ABBYY Cloud OCR SDK (part of ABBYY Vantage platform) is continuously updated – as of 2025 it incorporates FineReader’s newest recognition engines for printed and handwritten text.
	•	Pricing: Subscription-based, volume tiers. Starts at ~$99/month for 5,000 pages ￼ (≈$0.02 per page). Higher volumes or enterprise plans scale from there. This is considerably pricier per page than big-cloud offerings (e.g. ~13× the cost of Azure’s basic OCR) – reflecting ABBYY’s enterprise focus. However, that pricing includes all features (OCR, layout, etc.) and isn’t metered by tokens.
	•	OCR Strengths: Excellent accuracy and layout retention, especially for printed text in books. ABBYY is often the benchmark for OCR accuracy on complex documents – it consistently ranks at or near the top in independent OCR evaluations. It supports 200+ languages and can handle mixed-language documents. FineReader is known for preserving formatting: the SDK can output not just plain text but formatted PDF, DOCX or HTML with paragraphs, font styles, tables, footnotes, etc., closely mirroring the original page layout. It also has advanced image preprocessing (de-skew, noise removal, OCR for curved book pages). For books, ABBYY’s PDF output can be extremely useful for creating a searchable, nicely formatted e-book. The engine also excels at recognizing small fonts and multi-column layouts without confusion. ABBYY’s latest AI improvements target low-quality scans and tricky cases like historical fonts. In one anecdotal comparison, ABBYY’s OCR accuracy on a densely formatted textbook exceeded 98%, whereas open-source Tesseract achieved ~85% – showing the gap in quality. The SDK is accessible via API and has on-premise options as well (FineReader Server). For an AI-first pipeline, ABBYY could serve as a high-quality OCR component that feeds into an LLM for higher-level processing.
	•	Known Limitations: Cost and licensing are the main drawbacks. At ~$0.02 per page (and higher in lower volumes), ABBYY is one of the most expensive options ￼. It’s geared toward enterprises who demand accuracy above all. Another limitation is that ABBYY’s OCR is not a “vision-language model” – it won’t perform reasoning or cross-page analysis; it’s focused on text extraction. If the goal is to replace a multi-engine ensemble with a single AI, ABBYY alone doesn’t do reasoning or QA (though its superior OCR might reduce the need for an ensemble in the first place). Additionally, integration is a bit heavier – one must upload images/PDF to the ABBYY cloud or install their SDK. And while layout output is great, it can sometimes be too faithful, requiring cleanup (for example, it might include hyphenation line-breaks or exact spacing to preserve layout). Finally, ABBYY is a closed proprietary solution; unlike open-source OCR, you can’t finetune it or know its internals. In summary, ABBYY provides top-tier OCR accuracy and is ideal if fidelity is paramount and budget permits – it can serve as a high-watermark for text extraction quality ￼ ￼.
	9.	Alibaba Qwen-2.5 VL (Alibaba Cloud) – An open-weights vision-language model with strong document OCR abilities.
	•	Release/Update: Qwen-2.5-VL is an extension of Alibaba’s Qwen model family (Qwen 2.5 series, likely released in late 2024) ￼. It’s available as open-source checkpoints (7B and 14B parameters) with some under Apache 2.0 license ￼. Not directly offered as a public API outside Alibaba Cloud, but the model weights can be used via Hugging Face or Alibaba’s platform.
	•	Pricing: N/A (open model). Running Qwen2.5-VL requires self-hosting or an inference service – costs would come from cloud compute (VRAM-heavy: the 14B model typically needs a high-end GPU). Some checkpoints are freely usable commercially ￼, but others have license restrictions, so one must choose the appropriate version.
	•	OCR Strengths: High benchmark scores on document tasks. Qwen-2.5-VL has shown top-tier accuracy on OCR-specific benchmarks like OCRBench_v2 and DocVQA ￼. It is designed with grounding capabilities – meaning it not only transcribes text but can identify text positions (bounding boxes) and even point to regions in an image. It effectively combines a vision transformer with a language model, allowing it to output structured results (e.g. identifying a table cell’s content and its coordinates). This makes it valuable for complex layouts such as scientific papers with diagrams, or forms where spatial alignment matters ￼ ￼. Qwen’s multilingual OCR is also strong (Alibaba likely trained it on bilingual corpora, given their focus on English/Chinese global markets). In tests, Qwen2.5-VL handles charts and figures in documents better than many general models, because it was explicitly fine-tuned for those scenarios ￼. It can, for example, read a chart image and output the text in labels, or parse an academic paper PDF and answer questions about it. Essentially, Qwen2.5-VL bridges the gap between pure OCR and interactive Q&A on documents.
	•	Known Limitations: Resource intensity and availability. The model is large and “computationally intensive,” requiring a lot of VRAM and inference time ￼. This makes it less convenient to use at scale unless you invest in GPU servers or use a managed service (Alibaba Cloud’s version might not be easily accessible internationally). Also, the licensing is a bit complex: the 7B Qwen-VL is Apache 2.0 (open use), but the 14B may have a custom license restricting use ￼. For purely commercial projects, that needs attention. Another limitation is that, being open-source, it may not have the same level of polish or support as a commercial API – using it might involve more engineering (setting up pipelines to feed images and get outputs). Finally, while Qwen2.5-VL is very good, it’s not the very best model on every metric; for instance, Mistral’s specialized OCR edged it out in some internal tests ￼, and it’s unclear how it compares to giants like GPT-5. In summary, Qwen2.5-VL is a cutting-edge open model for OCR that offers flexibility and strong performance, but requires significant effort to utilize in an API-only scenario.
	10.	AI2 Molmo (Allen Institute) – A family of open multimodal models (7B–72B) that push the state of the art in vision-language, including OCR.
	•	Release/Update: First released Sept 25, 2024 ￼ (Molmo 7B and 34B demos, with a tech report on the 72B model). A follow-up Molmo-2 (focusing on video) came in 2025, but the original Molmo is most relevant for document OCR. Models and code are openly available ￼ ￼.
	•	Pricing: N/A (open-source). You can use Molmo for free; the cost is in providing GPU infrastructure. The 7B model can be run on a single high-end GPU, while the largest 72B model might require multiple GPUs. AI2 also provides a public demo and encourages community use (non-commercial).
	•	OCR Strengths: Closes the gap with proprietary models. Molmo’s 72B model was shown to perform comparably to GPT-4 (vision) and Claude 3.5 on many benchmarks ￼. In particular, it excelled at OCR-like tasks: the team specifically notes improved performance on “OCR-centric tasks like reading documents and charts” ￼. Molmo is trained on a high-quality multimodal dataset (PixMo) emphasizing accurate image descriptions and text in images ￼ ￼. It introduced a novel ability for the model to point to visual elements – for example, if asked “where is this quote on the page?”, Molmo could potentially indicate the location. For pure OCR, Molmo can certainly extract text from images effectively; plus, it can provide rich descriptions of formatting or context if needed. Because it was not distilled from other VLMs, Molmo has unique “knowledge” of visual-text patterns. It handles not just printed text but also things like hand-drawn diagrams, graphs, and even analog clocks with a level of reasoning ￼. Another strength: all components (vision encoder, language decoder) are open, which means the community can further fine-tune Molmo for specific OCR domains (e.g. historical books).
	•	Known Limitations: No turnkey API – using Molmo in an “API-only” product requires hosting it yourself or through a service like HuggingFace Inference Endpoint. This adds engineering overhead and complexity (and potentially higher latency than optimized commercial APIs). Also, while Molmo is very good, it’s essentially a research model; certain edge cases might not be as thoroughly handled as in a production OCR engine. For example, Molmo might struggle with extremely stylized text or OCR on non-Latin scripts unless fine-tuned (its training data, though multilingual in captions, may not cover all scripts as exhaustively as, say, ABBYY or Mistral’s multilingual OCR). Additionally, the absence of enterprise support means if something goes wrong (a strange failure mode on a certain layout), you’re largely on your own to debug or improve it. Molmo’s largest model is also resource-heavy, which might be impractical for real-time high-volume use. In summary, Molmo is a cutting-edge open model demonstrating that open-source can rival closed models for OCR and vision ￼, but it’s best suited for those willing to manage a custom deployment and possibly tailor it further.
	11.	IDEFICS 2 (Hugging Face) – An 8B-parameter open multimodal model with enhanced OCR capabilities.
	•	Release/Update: Published April 15, 2024 ￼ by Hugging Face and partners as an improvement over the original IDEFICS 80B model. IDEFICS 2 is open-source (Apache 2.0) and integrated into the Transformers library from day one ￼.
	•	Pricing: N/A (self-hosted). Being only 8B, it is relatively lightweight – it can be run on a single GPU for inference. There is no official API service, but one can use Hugging Face’s Inference API (paid by compute time) or host it on modest hardware compared to giant models.
	•	OCR Strengths: Despite its smaller size, IDEFICS 2 was specifically trained with OCR-related data for better text reading ￼ ￼. The training included datasets like PDFA (rendered documents) and scene text, significantly boosting its ability to transcribe text from images ￼. The developers highlight that “enhanced OCR capabilities” are a key feature of IDEFICS 2 ￼ ￼. Indeed, at 8B it achieved performance competitive with much larger models (it “competes with much larger models such as LLava-Next-34B” on vision benchmarks) ￼. IDEFICS 2 can answer questions about documents, extract info, and follow instructions involving images. For instance, you could show it a page and ask, “What does the third paragraph say?” and it can read it out. It’s also good at charts and figures for its size – thanks to training on tasks like DocVQA and TextVQA, it scored 74% on DocVQA test (only ~12 points behind a 34B model) ￼ ￼. The model’s small size means it’s fast and can be deployed in resource-constrained environments (even edge devices with quantization). It’s a great candidate for fine-tuning on domain-specific OCR (e.g. IDEFICS 2 could be further trained on medieval manuscript text or specific fonts given its open nature).
	•	Known Limitations: At 8B, it cannot match the absolute accuracy of the largest models on very challenging OCR tasks. It might mis-read text where a bigger model like GPT-5 or Molmo (72B) would succeed. There is also no built-in support for outputting structured formats or coordinates – using IDEFICS is more like chatting with an AI that can see. For example, you can prompt it to “read this image to text,” and it will do so, but ensuring it doesn’t skip or reorder lines may require careful prompting (given the model might focus on “important” content if not instructed otherwise). Also, IDEFICS 2’s availability is community-driven – while Hugging Face supports it, you won’t have a dedicated support line or SLA as you would with a paid API from OpenAI/Azure. Another factor: since it’s open, any updates/improvements rely on community or future releases (there’s no automatic “model upgrade” as with a cloud API). In sum, IDEFICS 2 is a powerful small model for OCR that offers flexibility and low cost, but it may serve best as a component in a larger system (or as a starting point for a custom-trained OCR model) rather than a turnkey solution for scale.

(Additional open models considered include PaLI/PaLI-X from Google and LLaVA-Next; however, many are available only as research checkpoints without hosted APIs, so they were excluded in favor of the above which have either API access or notable performance.)

Top 3 Recommendations

1. Mistral OCR – Best-in-class OCR accuracy at the lowest cost: Mistral’s dedicated OCR model is our top pick for an AI-first OCR pipeline. It delivers superior text extraction fidelity (outperforming big-tech models in benchmarks) ￼, excels at complex layouts (tables, formulas) ￼, and supports many languages – all at ~$0.001 per page ￼, which is an order of magnitude cheaper than most competitors. This model is purpose-built to replace multi-engine OCR ensembles; it understands documents holistically (outputting structured Markdown/JSON) and has the throughput for large-scale scanning. With Mistral OCR, we can likely simplify our stack (single API) while improving accuracy over Tesseract/EasyOCR, especially on challenging book pages. The main caveat is its newness – it’s a 2025 model from a startup – but given the evidence of its benchmark dominance and low cost, it’s the top recommendation for immediate integration and testing ￼ ￼.

2. OpenAI GPT‑5 Vision – Highest-quality AI OCR (benchmark & “beyond OCR” capabilities): As the latest flagship multimodal LLM, GPT-5 offers unmatched capability – it can not only transcribe text from images with very high accuracy, but also interpret and reason about the content ￼ ￼. For pure OCR, its accuracy on English print is expected to be on par with or exceeding the best (OpenAI hasn’t published OCR-specific metrics, but GPT-4’s vision was already very strong, and GPT-5 improves reasoning and reduces errors ￼). GPT-5 is our recommended “gold standard” benchmark – we should use it as a high-water mark for quality, even if its cost is high. It’s especially suited for cases where we might want to do more than OCR – e.g. ask questions about the text, summarize chapters, or detect complex structures – because it can handle all those tasks in one step. With a 400K token window, it can process entire book chapters in context ￼. We likely wouldn’t use GPT-5 for every page due to cost, but it’s ideal as an escalation option for difficult pages or as a validation mechanism to compare other models against. In short, GPT-5 will give us the highest OCR quality and versatility, making it a crucial part of our evaluation.

3. Cohere Command A Vision – Strong OCR performance with structured output, enterprise-friendly: Cohere’s Command A Vision model is a top choice to consider as an alternative to OpenAI/Google. It’s explicitly tuned for documents – internal tests show it beats GPT-4 on document QA and OCR benchmarks (e.g. ~83% vs 79% on combined vision tasks) ￼ – and importantly, it can output results in structured JSON (tables, form fields) without extra prompting ￼. This could let us replace parts of our pipeline that do layout parsing. Cohere also offers more flexible deployment (including on-prem options), which might align with data privacy needs. While it’s a new model, it leverages a large 112B backbone and has shown it can handle complex visual data like charts and multi-column PDFs ￼ ￼. The expected cost is similar to other large models, but Cohere’s willingness to do private deployments could reduce long-term costs if we process huge volumes (avoiding per-call fees). We recommend including Command A Vision in the shortlist to benchmark its OCR accuracy and throughput. If it lives up to its claims, it could serve as a high-quality, integrable OCR+analysis engine – potentially allowing us to consolidate OCR and post-processing in one step.

In summary, Mistral OCR addresses our core OCR needs with exceptional accuracy and cost-efficiency, GPT-5 provides an upper-bound on quality (and adds AI-superpowers for downstream tasks), and Cohere’s Command A Vision offers a promising balance of accuracy and structured understanding tailored for documents. These three, in our view, represent the best-of-breed in their categories and should be prioritized in our AI-first OCR pipeline evaluation.
