module_id: initialize_output_v1
stage: intake
description: |
  Initialize output directory structure at the start of the pipeline run.
  Creates output/, output/images/, copies validator/, and creates README.md.
  This ensures all stages can rely on output/ existing and having the correct structure.

params:
  - name: run_dir
    desc: Run directory path
    required: true
  - name: recipe
    desc: Optional path to recipe yaml; defaults to snapshots/recipe.yaml in run dir
    required: false

notes: |
  This module should run at the VERY beginning of the pipeline (before any other stages).
  It has no dependencies (needs: []) and creates the output/ directory structure that
  all subsequent stages rely on.
