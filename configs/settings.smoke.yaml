  # Grafting stubs using load_artifact_v1 (masquerading as normal stages)
  # This works because driver uses the module_id from the recipe but we can override params here.
  # WAIT: We can't easily swap module_id via settings.
  # So we have two options:
  # 1. Use the real modules with a `skip_ai` flag (if they support it).
  # 2. Use a dedicated smoke recipe.
  
  # Checking if ocr_ai_gpt51_v1 supports skip_ai
